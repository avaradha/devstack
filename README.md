devstack_vagrant
================

1. At the moment I am trying to install Openstack using Vagrant on my laptop
2. Idea is to autoinstall Devstack on my laptop using Vagrant
3. This currently uses a shell script provisioner to install devstack on a VM
4. Next step is to setup a network with two VM: One to act as the controller and one to act as a node
